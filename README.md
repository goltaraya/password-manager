## What's the Password Manager GUI App?
The Password Manager GUI is an app built in Python to save and manage your credentials to website. <br>

## How do I use it?
There are three fields:
* Website
* Email/Username
* Password

These fields must be filled with your credentials. After that, there is a button called '__ADD__'.<br>
When pressed, it's going to save that login data in a .JSON called '__data_passwords__'.<br>
Whenever you want, you can acess your credentials by typing the __WEBSITE__'s name at the website field and pressing '__SEARCH__'.<br>
If the website exists in the JSON file, it'll return your __EMAIL/USERNAME__ and __PASSWORD__ as a MessageBox.<br>
If doesn't, it'll return a MessageBox telling the user that there's no data from that website.

I hope it can be useful for you!<br>
